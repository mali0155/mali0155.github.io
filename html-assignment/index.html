  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p> 
    Hello! My name is Vishal Malik, and I am from <abbr title="India"></abbr>. I am currently studying <abbr title="Interactive Media design"></abbr> at Algonquin College. I moved to Canada two months ago with the goal of building a successful future. This new chapter allows me to pursue my dreams and focus on personal growth
  </p>
  <p> 
    Being in Canada helps me adapt to a new culture, gain independence, and develop important skills that will help me in my career and life. My goal is to work hard, learn as much as I can, and make my parents proud. I am excited to grow in the creative and digital world ahead.
